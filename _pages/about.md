Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am **Yilin Fang**, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://osu.edu/), where I am a member of [W3CIL Lab](https://carteryagemann.com/pages/w3cil-lab.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Carter Yagemann](https://carteryagemann.com/). My research focuses on the intersection of **computer security** and **machine learning**, particularly in **automated vulnerability discovery**, **analysis** and **prevention**.

Prior to joining OSU, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Cyberspace Security from the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2023, under the guidance of [Dr. Bin Yuan](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/yuanbin12/en/index.htm). During my master's program, it was my great fortune to work with [Dr. Yueming Wu](https://wu-yueming.github.io/) on **source-code-level vulnerability discovery** and **clone detection**. I also completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Security at HUST in 2020.

The best way to contact me is via [email](javascript:(()=>{const e='5B9A95D0B6E4BDC1050D561422AD556AE6',k='3DFBFBB798D58DF1324D39675783300E93';let m='';for(let i=0;i<e.length;i+=2)m+=String.fromCharCode(parseInt(e.substring(i,i+2),16)^parseInt(k.substring(i,i+2),16));location.href='mailto:'+m})()).
